# English Guideline Compliance Checker

## Project Overview 

The AI English Compliance Checker is a web-based application designed to help users ensure their documents adhere to English writing guidelines. It analyzes uploaded documents (PDF, DOCX, or DOC) for grammar mistakes, passive voice overuse, clarity issues, adherence to formal writing guidelines, and sentence structure problems. The app provides a detailed compliance report and, if necessary, suggests modifications to improve the document.
